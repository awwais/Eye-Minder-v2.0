# Eye-Minder v2.0

## üëÅÔ∏è Protect Your Vision, Boost Your Productivity

Did you know that the average person blinks 66% less when staring at a screen?[^1] This can lead to eye strain, headaches, and decreased productivity. Eye-Minder is here to help!

### What is Eye-Minder?

Eye-Minder is a desktop application built with PyQt5 that reminds you to follow the 20-20-20 rule:

> Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away.

This simple habit can significantly reduce eye strain and improve your overall well-being while working on your computer.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Customizable reminders**: Set intervals that work best for you
- **Non-intrusive notifications**: Stay focused while taking care of your eyes
- **Track your habits**: Monitor your adherence to the 20-20-20 rule
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üî¨ The Science Behind Eye-Minder

1. **Reduced eye strain**: Following the 20-20-20 rule can decrease symptoms of computer vision syndrome by up to 32%[^2]
2. **Improved focus**: Regular breaks can boost productivity by up to 13%[^3]
3. **Better sleep**: Reducing blue light exposure in the evening can improve sleep quality by 58%[^4]
